The newsletter contains a list of mail in and or Internet contests 
which <FONT COLOR=GREEN>CANADIAN RESIDENTS</FONT> are eligible to enter.  Win A Contest will find new 
contests and update the newsletter on a weekly basis.

<P>
We are so confident you will enjoy this newsletter that we are offering, 
as a trial, your FIRST MONTH FREE.   

<P>
Try expanding your contesting by entering contests available ONLY on the 
Internet.  In some cases the Internet is the only way you can enter.  
Contesting on the Internet does NOT require UPCs or entry forms!  

<P>
For each contest, the following information is included:  Contest closing 
date, number of times you can enter and how often, number of prizes, 
eligibility, age restrictions, any comments about the rules, even some of 
the answers to questions, and for Internet contests the EXACT WEB ADDRESS. 
This is the actual web page where you fill in the form.  Not the home page 
and wonder where the contest is, if the rules apply to you, whether or not 
it has expired, and if Canadians can enter.  I have made it so easy!  
Most software applications now allow you click on the web address in my
E-mail to go directly to the contest entry form.  When finished entering the
contest you return directly to my newsletter to enter the next contest.

<P>
Please consider the time and money saved by subscribing to  this newsletter.
It does NOT contain contests where you could win a hat, T-shirt, or 
miscellaneous items valued at less than <FONT COLOR=GREEN>$50.00</FONT>.  It only lists contests 
where winners could receive prizes such as trips, cash, cars, and other 
types of merchandise, which has been sponsored by a local or national 
business.  It will never have contests or surveys that ask for money.
