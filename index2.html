A Sweepstakes newsletter for <FONT COLOR=GREEN> residents of Canada </FONT>
containing information on where to win prizes by entering contests. EH!
<P>
Win A Contest Newsletter provides information on local, provincial and 
national contests where you can win trips, cars, cash, and other valuable 
prizes. This newsletter is available to you through E-mail or Canada Post 
containing updates for Mail In & In Store contests.  We will continue to 
look for new contests and update this newsletter on a weekly or biweekly 
basis.  For each contest, we include the following information:  Contest 
closing date, number of times you can enter, how often, number of prizes, 
eligibility, age restrictions, any comments about the rules, even some of 
the answers to questions, where to find the official form (if required) and 
where possible a hand drawn facsimile of the Universal Product Code. We 
average over 35 new contests in each mailed update.
<P>
I am so confident you will enjoy this method of entering contests that I am 
offering your FIRST MONTH FREE.  At the end of your first month free offer, 
if  you wish, you may sign up to become a member.
